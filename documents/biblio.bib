abstract = {Scheduling conferences is a common task in both research and industry, which requires relatively small groups to collaborate and negotiate in order to solve an often-large logistical problem with many nuances. For large conferences, the process can take days and it is traditionally a manual procedure performed using physical tools such as whiteboards and sticky notes. We present the design and implementation of StickySchedule, a multi-user application for use on interactive large-scale shared displays to better enable groups to organize large conference-scheduling data. To evaluate our tool, we present observations from novice users, and authentic use cases with expert feedback from organizers who are heavily involved in large conference scheduling. The main contributions of our work are documenting the collaborative and competitive aspects of conference scheduling, creating a tool that incorporates successful features and addresses identified issues with prior works, and verifying the usefulness of our tool by observing and discussing a variety of use cases, in both collocated and remote-distributed settings.},

General-purpose computing capacity grew at an annual rate of 58\%. The world{\textquoteright}s capacity for bidirectional telecommunication grew at 28\% per year, closely followed by the increase in globally stored information (23\%). Humankind{\textquoteright}s capacity for unidirectional information diffusion through broadcasting channels has experienced comparatively modest annual growth (6\%). Telecommunication has been dominated by digital technologies since 1990 (99.9\% in digital format in 2007), and the majority of our technological memory has been in digital format since the early 2000s (94\% digital in 2007).},

UDT was designed to effectively utilize the rapidly emerging high-speed wide area optical networks. It is built on top of UDP with reliability control and congestion control, which makes it quite easy to install. The congestion control algorithm is the major internal functionality to enable UDT to effectively utilize high bandwidth. Meanwhile, we also implemented a set of APIs to support easy application implementation, including both reliable data streaming and partial reliable messaging. The original UDT library has also been extended to Composable UDT, which can support various congestion control algorithms. We will describe in detail the design and implementation of UDT, the UDT congestion control algorithm, Composable UDT, and the performance evaluation.}
