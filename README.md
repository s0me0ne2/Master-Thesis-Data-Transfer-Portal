# Master-Thesis-Data-Transfer-Portal
## Repository created in order to track my porgress in preparing my Master Thesis - Data Transfer Portal

The main aim of the theis is to create web application that allows researchers without IT expertise to manage transfer of large amount of data. It will release users from the necessity of getting into the technical issues of the back-end data movers.

Initially this repository will serve as a place where I will try to track my progress and plan upcoming tasks connected with preparing the thesis. At the later date it will be decided if the data portal will be created in this repository or if I will create a new one for that purpose.
